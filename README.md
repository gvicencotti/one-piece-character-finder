# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è One Piece Character Finder

This project was developed as part of the **DIO** Docker course.
The initial goal was to create a simple "Hello World" project running in an Apache container with Docker.
The project evolved into a small character finder for the One Piece anime, with a public API and dynamic information in a custom interface.


## üìå About the project

The application is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is run in a Docker container with Apache as the web server.

When you type a character's name, the system queries the [One Piece public API](https://www.freepublicapis.com/one-piece-api) and displays information such as occupation, age, bounty, and other data.
